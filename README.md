# ScavengerGame
This repo is used the client side in Scavenger Game designed by Tom Igoe at ITP for the Understanding Networks class.

The html page is acting as an interface to find BluetoothLE peripherals(beacons) and make post requests to a server to get points. 
Both server and client side js programming were involved.
